### Description
This is the learning project to practice React :)

By selecting a number of items, typing their names and clicking the "Add" button you can visualize all the data in a beautiful list. 
Apart from that, you are able to cross the item out in case you've already packed it or even completely delete it by clicking the "‚ùå" sign.

At the bottom of the page there is a pop-up list for 3 types of sorting and a "Clear list" button to delete all added items.

Also, the page automatically counts the number of added things, the number of packed things and the percentage of list completion based on above mentioned values. In each case a certain message is output.
